## Grader comments

It seems to adding in taller bars for some reason.  2) there are still some issues with the highlighting, such as multiple bars being highlighted at the same time, and bars remaining highlighted even after the sorting is over.  3) you need to fix your style violations (run 'mvn checkstyle:check'"
